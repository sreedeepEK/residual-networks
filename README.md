### Implementation of ResNet in PyTorch

This Repository implements the "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" paper from scratch using pure PyTorch. The design principles and architecture used in this implementation aim to demonstrate the efficacy of residual learning and its impact on performance in image classification tasks.

#### Key Components

The architecture begins with a convolutional layer that processes the input image and extracts features through filters, producing 64 feature maps. Following this, batch normalization is applied to the output of the convolutional layer, enhancing both the speed and stability of the training process. The ReLU activation function is then utilized to introduce non-linearity, enabling the model to learn complex patterns in the data.

One of the most important features of this network is its use of identity blocks. These blocks allow the original input to bypass certain layers, which helps maintain the flow of information through the network and makes training more manageable. Additionally, pooling layers are included to reduce the size of the feature maps, concentrating on the most significant features and making computations more efficient.

At the end of the architecture, a fully connected layer takes the final output from the preceding layers and generates classification scores for each class in the dataset.

This architecture stands out due to its effective residual learning approach, which simplifies the task of training very deep networks. The inclusion of skip connections allows gradients to flow easily during training, thereby preventing issues like vanishing gradients. As a result, this model often outperforms many traditional models, making it a favored choice for various image classification tasks.

#### Why Use Residual Networks

- Residual Learning: The main idea is that it allows the model to learn the difference between the output and the input (the residual), which makes it easier to train very deep networks.
- Skip Connections: These connections help gradients flow through the network without vanishing, allowing for better training of deeper models.
- Performance: Residual networks have demonstrated superior performance on various image classification tasks compared to traditional networks of similar depth due to their innovative architecture.

#### dvantages of This Architecture

- Addressing Vanishing Gradients: Traditional deep networks often face the problem of vanishing gradients, where the gradients become very small as they propagate back through many layers, making training difficult. Skip connections help preserve the gradient, allowing for more effective training of deeper networks.

- Better Performance: Residual architectures have consistently outperformed many other deep learning architectures in image classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.
